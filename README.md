# Fruity Marketing Agency Website Code Refractor

## Description

My client Fruity Marketing Agency wants a codebase that follows accesibility standards so that their own site is optimized for search engines.

I viewed the original webpage code and made the following changes:
-Reformatted HTML to have better structure of HTML elements
-Changed some HTML elements to <header> and <section> elements for better accesibilty
-Removed unnecessary spaces that did not benefit the HTML structure
-Reorganized CSS selectors and properties to follow structure of HTML
-Consolidated CSS selectors and properties for better accesibility
-Added comments to CSS to show changes that was made for reference
-Added a proper title to describe the website
-Fixed heading links so all three links work properly
